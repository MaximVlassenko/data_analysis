## Analysis of TV sales and the impact of advertising on sales.

#### In this example, I will analyze real TV sales data for the period 08/01/22-11/15/22 in Kazakhstan, in one of the largest retail chains selling electronics and home appliances. The data shown in the example is real, but adjustments have been made to maintain confidentiality. Additional conditions: it is known that in the period 01.10-31.10 an advertising campaign was launched in Google Adwords for the LG brand. 
### Tasks:
#### 1. Analyze TV sales in general.
#### 2. Understand whether the advertising campaign had an impact on sales and analyze how much, if so.
#### There are two data sets: TV_Data.xlsx - it stores TV sales data and tv_adv - it contains advertising campaign indicators.
