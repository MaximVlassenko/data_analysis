## Analysis of TV sales and the impact of advertising on sales.

#### In this example, I will analyze real TV sales data for the period 08/01/22-11/15/22 in Kazakhstan, in one of the largest retail chains selling electronics and home appliances. The data shown in the example is real, but adjustments have been made to maintain confidentiality. Additional conditions: it is known that in the period 01.10-31.10 an advertising campaign was launched in Google Adwords for the LG brand.
